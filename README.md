# TouchEvents

Library to help handle touch events

## Documentation

[Package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/knledg/touch-events/latest)

## Run Example

`cd examples && elm make SwipeExample.elm && open index.html`

Be sure to view in a mobile device emulator like the one found in Chrome Dev Tools since touch events are only triggered on mobile devices


## Run tests

1. Run `npm install -g elm-test` if you haven't already.
2. `cd` into the project's root directory that has your `elm-package.json`.
3. Run `elm-test init`. 
4. Run `elm-test`.
